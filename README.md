# Exam_rank_02
The first exam of school21 main course, which I passed at fourth try with inter and ftprintf.
The ftprinf can be checked with printfTester [https://github.com/Tripouille/printfTester], but you have to create the libftprintf.a. 

In the get_next_line directory I also added my test.sh script, which is similar as the test script you will have on exam. It take a source file and give it as the parameter of gnl program and compare the output with original file using "diff". It also execute the generator of HUGE file and do the same. If your gnl work correctly, you will see something likely as the figure below. It also take as the parameter of gnl the generator.exe, but gnl output will (and should) differ with generator.exe (because it is binary file, obviously).
